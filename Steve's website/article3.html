Bring one knee up towards your chest and twist your torso so that the opposite elbow comes over towards it. Your elbow and knee neednâ€™t touch, but thinking of that connection between the two body parts is a good way to guide the movement of your torso. Lower both your torso and leg at the same time, then repeat on the opposite side.</h3>

This is your starting position. Rotate torso to right side so that right elbow is hovering just off mat. Keep lower body still while rotating upper body to left side until left elbow is just off mat. Return to start. Gaze follows hands as you move. That's one rep. </h3>
