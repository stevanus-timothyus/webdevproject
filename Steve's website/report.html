Report: Large Coursework
Stevanus Timothyus

-Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement.
The story told through my site is to emphasize the importance of taking care of our body through healthy and balanced diet as well as muscular training to maintain our body's ability to stay stronger as we age.

The structure I chose to implement is a simple, natural toned website to give the impression that we're a part of the nature that needs care, just like our motherearth.

-State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.
I am inspired to create the website because of:
1. Existence of mental health websites such as https://www.mentalhealth.gov/ but theres none thats dedicated for taking care of our physical well being.
2. Google search is another insipiration for its ability of creating webpage search results using templates.
3. Medical websites and websites that suggest statistically pleasing medical information's strucural display designs that led me to come up with the proper font, sense of space usage in the webpages along with colour tones. In Particular https://theprintauthority.com/best-fonts-for-medical-printed-materials/ inspired me to use comfortaa and Rockwell fonts.

-State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.
1.Obvious navigation system
2.Can be nagivated using mouse only.
3.Can be used in different browsers.
  
-State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.
1.It has viewing compatibility for other devices such that the interface suits different screen size ie.on the phone.
2.Easy to navigate around as site is has a considerably simple design
3.Good colour contrast used and visually appealing fonts allowing users to comfortably see the contents
  
-State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).
1. Suitable placement of javascript, either in-line or in another file.
2. Finding ways to use search engine.
3. How cookies can be stored and used.

-What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?
Using a simple search loop allows a quick search of keywords.

-What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?
Using handlebars in conjunction to databases like SQL to store data such as log in details and articles information to be used for templating.

-What resources were used when creating your work? You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.

Taking things from the web
You can use almost anything you like that you can find on the Web, but you should avoid anything that is not open (e.g. that costs money or requires login or registration), or anything from sites belonging to commercial companies.  Being able to re-use other people's ideas is an important web skill. However, it is essential that, on your report page, you describe what you have taken, where you took it from, and what you have done to it. If you copy-and-paste something almost without change, you must say that you have done it, it must conform to the standards, and you shouldn't expect many marks for it, except for how you have made it fit in with and enhance your own design. To get more marks you can use code from elsewhere, document the source of the code in your report.html and then edit it in some way. Showing you can adapt existing code will earn you more marks. In order to be clear which material you have written and which you have used from elsewhere you will be expected to provide comprehensive comments within your HTML, CSS and Javascript files indicating code you have used, code you have adopted and edited and code that you have written.
