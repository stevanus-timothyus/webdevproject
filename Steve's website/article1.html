      <h3 style="margin-left: 40px">The best way of burning fats inside our body is to watch out for our diet. Doing so will allow our body to utilise our fats for energy and eventually helps us to cut down weight. The 5 most popular diet plan of 2021 are:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Intermitten Fasting</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">There are mainly 2 ways to do intermitten fasting, one is to periodically consume a very low amount of calorie diet in which most people do a 5:2 where in a week, they can eat whatever they want for the 5 days while for the 2 days, they will cosume roughly only 500 calories. Another way of doing intermitten is to restrict eating window, and fasting the rest of the time. Most people restrict their eating to an 8-hour window, although you sure can do lesser if you can manage.</h3>
          (insert image of )
          <h3 class="pointDD">The way intermitten fasting work is by exhausting the body of its sugar stores from food and therefore allowing it to start burning fat at a longer period. This is because when we eat, we are running on energy of the food we eat, preventing the body from burning fats.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Ketogenic Diet</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">This method of dieting is one where food intake needs to be strictly managed, the idea behind this diet is to consume less than a total 20g of carbohydrates a day for the entire duration of the diet. This means food such as fruits or processed foods is forbidden in this diet. Whilst this diet might be extremely hard given that sugar craving will develop to tempt you out of the diet, it is however the most efficient and fastest way to lose fats.</h3>
      
          <h3 class="pointDD">The way ketogenic diet work is by putting the body into a ketosis state, where fats is used instead as the main source of energy for all our energy needs.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Low Fat Diet</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">Like ketogenic diet, a low fat diet has also been popular. The diet involves restricting fat intake to as low as possible, with people normally setting to 30% of daily calories while others may go to as low as 10%.</h3>
          <h3 class="pointDD">However unlike ketogenic diet, this diet works as fat provides about twice the number of calories per gram, compared to protein and carbs.As such this diet are often plant-based diets.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Volumetrics Diet</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">Rated as one of the best diets by U.S. News and World Report is the volumetric diet. This diet plan make use of the fact that some food are higher in nutrients and lower in calories than other food. By planning meals to include as many lower calories food, dieters would therefore consume fewer calories, therefore they can drop more weight.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Restrict Calorie Diet</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">While other restriction diet focuses on specific macronutrient, this diet is as simple as it can get. Basically one just have to limit their calorie intake to be that below of their daily calorie needs for a period of time. While this diet might not be sustainable in the long run but its simple short term rapid weight loss sure does attract a lot of people.</h3>
