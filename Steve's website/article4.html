          <h2 class="pointTT">Drink a cup of coffee before a morning workout</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">Caffeine helps to stimulate the central nervous system to make you more energized and ready for your gym workout.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Have a proper warm up.</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">Doing some dynamic stretches helps to raise the body temperature and heart rate, as well as warming up the muscles allowing you to be mroe prepared for gym activities.</h3>
          <h3 class="pointDD">The dynamic warm-up can also help improve one's range of motion,so that you can get deeper into each exercise and reap the full strengthening benefits of each move.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Minimise rest time between exercises</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">Set a short timer to help shorten rest time, this way, you'll not only increase the intensity of your workout but also help to keep your heart rate elevated throughout the session.</h3>
          <h3 class="pointDD">Another way to minimise rest time is to involve supersets, a workout routine where you do two exercises back to back without any rests in between. Typically a superset involve exercises that target different muscle groups.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Pick the right weight.</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">Choosing a weight thats heavy enough will help challenge your muslces just enough to grow stronger. A heavier wright would only tire your muscle out faster.</h3>
          <h3 class="pointDD">To choose the right weight, it will take some trial and error. In general find a weight comfortable enough for you to do 8-10 cycles of the exercise you're doing.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Make a mental connection to your targeted muscle.</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">Many people forget that an exercise can activate different groups of muscle and therefore overlooked the fact that to build a particular muscle, we need to ensure we are engaging it when we are exercising.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Doing high-intensity interval training</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">High-intensity interval training or HIIT in short, refers to short burst of very hard work followed by periods of recovery.The work periods are typically 20 to 90 seconds, during which you should be giving it your all, whether thatâ€™s a sprint on a treadmill or nonstop burpees.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Engage the most amount of muscle group</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">While this allow more muscle group to be trained, it also help you to minimise rest time as you would feel less tired engaging a muscle that had not have any lactic acid build up yet.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Recovery days</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">Recovery days are one of the most important fundamentals of muscle building. Did you know your muscle only grows in the recovery period?</h3>
          <h3 class="pointDD">Yes you heard me right, this is because during work out, as you challenge your muscles, you only cause micro-tears to form in your muscle fibers. The muscle is only build in the post-gym session where your body will try to rebuild the damaged muscle fibers to become stronger.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="pointTT">Eat enough protein</h2>
          <h3 class="pointDD">As mentioned earlier, muscles only grow when the body try to repair the muscle, this is done by using up protein (the basic building blocks for muscles). Hence it is important that the body has enough protein it can use to build a stronger muscle.</h3>
